Please provide a brief biography about yourself. This may include what you do for work, what you study, what projects you’re involved in, or what you are passionate about. Maximum 700 characters (~100 words).

During my 6 years as a UCSF postdoc I have been deeply involved in open science advocacy, as an Ambassador for iBiology and ASAPbio, as a producer for the podcast Carry the One Radio, as a committee member of the Science Policy Group at UCSF, and as part of the Mozilla Science Lab community where I am co-developing a Preprint Journal Club Starter Kit with Daniela Saderi. Open = fair and honest, which are at the core of who I am, therefore, my passion for Open Science runs deep. I am particularly driven to bring the art of research back to the science itself and, through preprint advocacy, help remove the pressure to comply to Impact Factor culture. Let’s make science fun again!
