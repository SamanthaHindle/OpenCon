#### Please provide a brief biography about yourself. This may include what you do for work, what you study, what projects you’re involved in, or what you are passionate about. Maximum 700 characters (~100 words).

During my 6 years as a UCSF postdoc I have been deeply involved in open science advocacy, as an Ambassador for iBiology and ASAPbio, as a producer for the podcast Carry the One Radio, as a committee member of the Science Policy Group at UCSF, and as part of the Mozilla Science Lab community where I am co-developing a Preprint Journal Club Starter Kit with Daniela Saderi. Open = fair and honest, which are at the core of who I am, therefore, my passion for Open Science runs deep. I am particularly driven to bring the art of research back to the science itself and, through preprint advocacy, help remove the pressure to comply to Impact Factor culture. Let’s make science fun again!

#### Why are you interested in OpenCon?
##### In your own words, tell us why you are interested in Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data and how these issues relate to your work. If you are already working on these issues please tell us how. Maximum 1400 characters (~200 words).

I became aware of OpenCon when Gary McDowell invited me to speak at OpenCon SF (2017). This was a life-changing event as I met Danielle Robinson and Kirstie Whitaker (Mozilla Science Lab fellows) who invited me to speak at the mini-WOW-PDX meeting; this led to my first experience of working open. I am now immersed in the open community and all thanks to the OpenCon satellite meeting. I want to attend OpenCon Berlin to empower other open science advocates, like I was after OpenCon SF. 
My drive for OA stems from a passion for open flow of science from the bench to the public. As an [iBiology Ambassador](http://bit.ly/2tTDIE5), a [Carry the One Radio podcast producer](http://bit.ly/2w0WVVK), and a co-organizer of the Bay Area Science Communication MeetUp group, I am dedicated to promoting Open Science Education and the training of scientists to become better communicators.
As a researcher, I have struggled with the unfairness in which we reward and incentivize scientists, through publication Impact Factors rather than actual research impact. I was naturally drawn to ASAPbio and I’m committed to promoting their goals: to accelerate open and rapid access to scholarly works by promoting the integration of preprints into Biology. From Day 1, I have been a dedicated [ASAPbio Ambassador](http://bit.ly/2viaOkv), co-hosting town hall meetings and representing ASAPbio at various conferences.
