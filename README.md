# OpenCon

This repository contains my [OpenCon2017 application](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/OpenCon/blob/master/OpenCon2017%20Application.md). I hope you will find it both interesting and useful. 

It also includes some of my upcoming ideas for Open Science workshops, so if you are interested in contributing to these, please don't hesitate to create an issue.

I will also post future updates related to the Open Access and Open Education Week events described in my application.
